# monosynapse-dynamics

This repository contains all the Python scripts necessary to generate all the plots shown in the manuscript, 
"Can We Infer Monosynaptic Dynamics from Spike Times in Vivo?". 

Run the bash script 'figures-generator.sh' to recreate all the plots (in command line: '$ bash figures-generator.sh').
In this script, the relation between the Python scripts and the figures is detailed.
