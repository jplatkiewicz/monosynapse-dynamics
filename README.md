# monosynapse-dynamics

This repository contains all the Python scripts necessary to generate all the plots shown in the manuscript, 
"Can We Infer Monosynaptic Dynamics from Spike Times in Vivo?". 

To recreate all the plots at once, simply run the bash script 'figures-generator.sh' (in command line: '$ bash figures-generator.sh').
The relations between the Python commands and the figures are detailed in this script.
